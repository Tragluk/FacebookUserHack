# FacebookUserHack
Python version based on a joke

We get a few people every once in a while who are looking to learn 'hacking' as if it's some mystical art that is taught.
Sooo..  now we have a 'hack' we can give them.

The screen reads 'Facebook Hack' and is in lime-green text with a black background (necessary for a good hack) as well as having
an ascii-skull (also necessary for a good hack).  It prompts the user for a Facebook Username.

With words that mean absolutely nothing in this context, it 'Loads the CheckSUM' of the username and begins 'Decrypting' it...

...Forever.

Row upon row of random numbers (still in hacker-green) scroll across the screen doing their work of 'Decrypting' a username.
Feel free to redistribute, modify, and prank those who are looking to get into this hardcore neon filled cyberpunk hacking scene.

See how long they'll run it before they give up.
